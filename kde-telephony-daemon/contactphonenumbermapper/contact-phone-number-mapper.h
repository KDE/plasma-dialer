/*
 * This class tries to match a phonenumber to one of your contacts.
 * This is not an easy tasks and involves some heuristics and tradeoffs.
 *
 * It works by maintaining a mapping from phonenumbers to KPeople URIs.
 * Since phonenumbers can be written in different formats the numbers are
 * normalized to a common form before comparing.
 *
 * If a contact's phonenumber in the address book is saved without a country
 * code then we need to guess a country. Guessing the country based on the locale
 * is problematic for people that have e.g. their phone in English but live
 * in Germany and assume the German country code in their address book.
 * Querying the country based on the cell network/MCC is problematic when travelling
 * abroad and the MCC changes.
 *
 * Our heuristic works like this:
 * First we normalize the number based on the cell network country and store the mapping.
 * If the locale's country is different to the cell network country we normalize the number
 * based on that and add it to the mapping as well.
 * When a call is received we first normalize the number based on the cell network country and
 * ask the mapping. If there is no entry we do the same based on the locale country.
 *
 * This covers the case of someone from Germany with English locale and the case of someone
 * from Germany using German locale travelling to France. It does not cover the case of
 * someone from Germany using English locale travelling to France.
 *
 * When the MCC changes, i.e. when we cross the border the mapping is cleared and redone with the new MCC.
